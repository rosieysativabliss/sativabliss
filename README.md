Cannabis in Canada: Looking Back in 2020 and What’s In Store for 2021

It wasn’t long since the legalization of cannabis was passed in Canada.  It wasn’t just for medicinal but the use of products derived from it like cannabis tea and cannabis edibles for recreational purposes have been made legal.  This year will mark its third anniversary in the industry and the growth of consumers and producers sees optimism amidst the pandemic. 

Reminiscing 2020…

And because COVID-19 has mostly taken over the spotlight for 2020, cannabis industry players have been challenged on how they will be able to cope.  Investment is still low which yielded difficulty in expansion for producers.  Thankfully, they are able to survive the year by engaging in partnerships with the intent of creating a long-term connection. 
One cannabis retail company that continues to provide its wide range of products despite the coronavirus scare to consumers is Sativa Bliss Cannabis.  With their E-commerce site and stores growing throughout Ontario, cannabis shopping has never been this easier.  Sativa Bliss prides itself in offering a wide variety of cannabis products for all types of cannabis users, from beginners to the connoisseur.  Offering products for all budgets. The stores are well stocked with all types of cannabis flower: Sativa,Indica, and Hybrid in a variety of strains. They also have a large variety of vaporizers, edibles,and pre-rolls. 

Even though the competition is tough in this emerging industry, Sativa Bliss plans to stand out from other retails by focusing on creating a welcoming environment and incomparable in-store experience.  Consumers are being more selective these days, which is why having transparency, communication and customer-first attitude is the real key to their success.

Predicting 2021…

While the flower-based products have the major share of purchases for cannabis, this year will be promising for cannabis extracts given that the sophistication of consumers increase, as well as variety and availability. 

The global Cannabis industry is expected to boom as it appears that the United States will soon be legalizing Cannabis on a federal level.  This will open the doors to many other countries to do the same.  As the industry grows, more global trade will happen and the number of cannabis products available to consumers will also increase.  Sativa Bliss will directly contact customers to get their feedback on the demand for new products.

Healthy competition is a big win for consumers. As customer service plays a major role in sales, retail companies should also not forget the quality of their product.  In lieu of this, cultivators continue to grow their operations, extractors develop their processes and the same goes with logistics.  Also, this year will make way for some of the unusual products to take on the market such as topicals, water-solubles, and exotic cannabinoids.  The market for introductory consumers will also likely take place within the year with the encouragement of the new line of products.

Well, that is an exciting way to look forward to cannabis this 2021.  There can still be regulations and growing limitations but that should not hinder the overall revenue the cannabis industry will experience.  Canada welcomed cannabis with open-mindedness and the best is yet to come with the onset of greater possibilities for expansion.  If you are on the look-out for the top of the line cannabis products at an affordable price, Sativa Bliss is your both physical and virtual go-to store.
